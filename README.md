# Zidio AI-Powered Task Optimizer
## Overview
Zidio AI-Powered Task Optimizer leverages data science and machine learning techniques to analyze employee emotions and moods using various data inputs. The system provides insights into the emotional state of employees and recommends tasks that align with their mood to enhance productivity and well-being.

## Features
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Combines text analysis, live camera video, and speech processing to detect employee emotions comprehensively.
- **Stress Management Alert**    : Automatically notifies HR or managers when an employeeâ€™s mood indicates prolonged stress or disengagement.
- **Task Recommendation**        : Suggests tasks based on the detected mood.
- **Team Mood Analytics**        : Aggregates mood data across teams to identify overall morale and productivity trends.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Zidio-AI-Powered-Task-Optimizer.git
    cd Zidio-AI-Powered-Task-Optimizer
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
1. Run the main application:
   python main.py
2.The application will simulate the detection of an employee's emotion and recommend a task based on that emotion. It will also alert HR if the employee is detected to be stressed.
## Future Work
  Implement real emotion detection using machine learning models.
  Integrate facial recognition and speech analysis for more accurate mood detection.
  Develop a front-end interface for HR and employees to interact with the system.
## License
  This code provides a basic structure for the Zidio AI-Powered Task Optimizer.
  It includes simulated functionality for emotion detection, task recommendation, and alerting HR. 
  In a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholders with actual machine learning models and data processing techniques.
